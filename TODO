FEATURES

 * annotations

 * square plot (tie x and y shapes) (lockAspectRatio)

 * text labels for major ticks
 * tick values
 
 * columns
 * candlestick

 * adjustable elements ((x,y) adjustments/offsets)
 * settable plot sizes (so we can have same plot areas with only bottom one with x axis)

 * Simple interface: nice bars, histograms (see next line)
 * bars/columns adjust for multiple data series (data creation)

 * 3d plots

 * ticks selectable inside/outside

 * better tick value formatting and selection algorithm

 * logarithmic minor tick positions

BUGS

 * fix error bars for non-points (esp. bars, hist)
 
 * no ticks for greyscale?

 * scale (log/linear) attached to range?

 * logarithmic tick label width adjustment?

 * move monotone increasing check to creation of dataseries

 * should scale be in setRange*?

 * axis and tick joins are ugly

REFACTOR

 * using padding functions not raw data structure: pdFoo, pdBar

 * directly to impulse, step, area, not via line (performance)

 * refactor Legend (LegendLocation)
 * replace with utility functions common code in Render/Data.hs
 * check Render/Data.hs, Render/Axis.hs

COMPLETE
