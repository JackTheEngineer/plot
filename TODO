FEATURES

 * annotations

 * square plot (tie x and y shapes) (lockAspectRatio)

 * log/semilog plots

 * text labels for major ticks
 * tick values
 
 * columns
 * histogram (variable width bars)

 * bars/columns adjust for multiple data series (data creation)

 * adjustable elements ((x,y) adjustments/offsets)
 * settable plot sizes (so we can have same plot areas with only bottom one with x axis)

| * expand Simple interface: xlabel, ylabel, etc...

 * 3d plots

 * Graphics.Plot replacement

 * ticks selectable inside/outside

BUGS

 * fix errors for non-points (esp. bars, hist)
 
 * no ticks for greyscale?

REFACTOR

 * using padding functions not raw data structure: pdFoo, pdBar

 * directly to impulse, step, area, not via line (performance)

 * refactor Legend (LegendLocation)
 * replace with utility functions common code in Render/Data.hs
