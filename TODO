 * text labels for major ticks
| * area
 * columns
 * bars
| * impulses
| * steps
| * matrix (greyscale)
 * square plot (tie x and y shapes) (lockAspectRatio)
| * legend
 * annotations
 * 3d plots

| * pad side opposite of axis label only if there is no label on that side
 * using padding functions not raw data structure: pdFoo, pdBar

| * simple interface
 * tick values
 
 * adjustable elements ((x,y) adjustments/offsets)
 * settable plot sizes (so we can have same plot areas with only bottom one with x axis)

| * option to use upper ranges

 * directly to impulse, step, area, not via line (performance)

 * expand Simple interface: xlabel, ylabel, etc...

 * refactor Legend (LegendLocation)
 * replace with utility functions common code in Render/Data.hs

| * fix linewidths (as per cairo FAQ) by adding 0.5 to rectangle start / line (borders/axes)
