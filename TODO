 * text labels for major ticks

 * columns
 * bars
 * square plot (tie x and y shapes) (lockAspectRatio)

 * annotations

 * 3d plots

 * using padding functions not raw data structure: pdFoo, pdBar

 * tick values
 
 * adjustable elements ((x,y) adjustments/offsets)
 * settable plot sizes (so we can have same plot areas with only bottom one with x axis)

 * directly to impulse, step, area, not via line (performance)

 * expand Simple interface: xlabel, ylabel, etc...

 * refactor Legend (LegendLocation)
 * replace with utility functions common code in Render/Data.hs

 * no ticks for greyscale?

 * log/semilog plots

| * area
| * impulses
| * steps
| * matrix (greyscale)
| * legend
| * pad side opposite of axis label only if there is no label on that side
| * simple interface
| * option to use upper ranges
| * fix linewidths (as per cairo FAQ) by adding 0.5 to rectangle start / line (borders/axes)
