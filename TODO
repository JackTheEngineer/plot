FEATURES

 * square plot (tie x and y shapes) (lockAspectRatio)

 * text labels for major ticks
 * tick values
 * ticks selectable inside/outside
 * better tick value formatting and selection algorithm
   -> add (tickpos),(labelpos,labelvalue)

 * logarithmic minor tick positions
 
 * columns

 * adjustable elements ((x,y) adjustments/offsets)
 * settable plot sizes (so we can have same plot areas with only bottom one with x axis)

 * Simple interface: nice bars, histograms (see next line)
 * bars/columns adjust for multiple data series (data creation)

 * 3d plots

 * recycle Cairo context between invocations of renderFigure

BUGS

 * fix error bars for non-points (esp. bars, hist)
 
 * no ticks for greyscale?

 * scale (log/linear) attached to range?

 * logarithmic tick label width adjustment?

 * should scale be in setRange*?

 * draw axes and ticks separately so we get nice joins (refactor) 
   actually draw tick labels separately, but not an issue any more

 * tick lengths too small for large axis line width?

 * export Data.Colour.Names

 * 0 in log plots should be ignored

REFACTOR

 * using padding functions not raw data structure: pdFoo, pdBar

 * directly to impulse, step, area, not via line (performance)

 * refactor Legend (LegendLocation)
 * replace with utility functions common code in Render/Data.hs
 * check Render/Data.hs, Render/Axis.hs

 * rationalise passing of xscale/yscale

COMPLETE

| * area
| * impulses
| * steps
| * matrix (greyscale)
| * legend
| * pad side opposite of axis label only if there is no label on that side
| * simple interface
| * option to use upper ranges
| * fix linewidths (as per cairo FAQ) by adding 0.5 to rectangle start / line (borders/axes)
| * expand Simple interface: xlabel, ylabel, etc...
| * bars
| * histogram (variable width bars)
| * Graphics.Plot replacement
| * log/semilog plots
| * candlestick
| * axis and tick joins are ugly
| * annotations
| * move monotone increasing check to creation of dataseries
| * formattable grid lines
| * cairo in device coordinates not user to avoid tiny linewidths
